    <h1>Simple Ways to Silence Self-Doubt</h1>

    <p>Self-doubt is quite common. It visits you like a friend every now and then, and you don’t even realize when your self-talk changes and how you get hypnotized by the magic of self-doubt. Sounds relatable?</p>

    <h2>Questions to Ask When Self-Doubt Hits</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>What’s actually hidden behind the doubt?</li>
        <li>How hard am I being on myself? Why am I being hard the way I am?</li>
        <li>What happens to my identity when I make self-doubt my world?</li>
        <li>What’s my identity when I just OBSERVE self-doubt rather than swimming in it?</li>
        <li>What would I do if I didn’t fear failing?</li>
        <li>What’s the worst that could happen if I try?</li>
        <li>What’s the best that could happen if I try?</li>
        <li>What advice would I give a friend in this situation?</li>
        <li>Right now, what smallest step can I take to deal with self-doubt?</li>
        <li>What have I already accomplished that felt impossible?</li>
        <li>Who would I be IF I DON’T let self-doubt CONTROL me?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>It’s ok to doubt yourself. It’s natural.</p>
    <p>But don’t let it scare you. The moment it feels scary, tune into your body and experience the sensations. Let the sensations rise and fall and just observe them, not absorb.</p>
    <p>Ask these questions. Get clarity. Keep progressing.</p>

        <h2>A Few More Ways to Encounter Self-Doubt</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Visualize Success:</strong> Spend a few minutes each day imagining yourself achieving your goals. Imagine everything in detail—sight, smell, touch—immerse yourself in the envisioned reality. This will help reduce the impact of self-doubt.</li>
            <li><strong>Be Your Friend:</strong> Role-play where you place two chairs facing each other. On one chair, speak from your doubtful self. On the other, assume the role of a friend who is guiding you. Switching between roles in this talk therapy helps heal through compassion and kindness.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <p class="highlight">Make Life Uncomplicated. It all starts with a DECISION to deal with the doubt and not get drained by it.</p>
