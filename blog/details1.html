    <h1>How Your Ego-centric Behaviour Could Be Your Enemy</h1>
    <p>
        Do you find yourself judging people for the way they look, dress up, speak, laugh, cry, etc? 
        Do you have a desire to prove your point as right? Do you get uncomfortable when your point of view 
        is questioned because you want to be proved right? Do you feel insecure when attacked?
        Do you have a fear of the unknown and live in that fear, without enjoying your present?
    </p>
    <p>
        Do you fear to let go of one identity that you have been living for years and find it hard to accept a new identity?
        Do you feel a sense of attachment to objects or people and find it hard to detach from them and just experience them for what/who they are?
        Do you find it hard to surrender after you have pushed hard to bring results in your favour?
        Do you feel a sense of superiority or inferiority when interacting with different sets of people?
    </p>
    <p>
        Whether your answer is Yes or No, it is common for the majority of people to find themselves saying “Yes” to these questions.
    </p>
    <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
    <p>
        These are all ego-centric behaviours. They don’t allow you to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Have a wider perspective, and eventually, you end up having misunderstandings and conflicts because you don’t see a full picture.</li>
        <li>Take feedback and criticism with an open mind, and thus your growth becomes stagnant.</li>
        <li>Value people in relationships; due to your ego-centric behaviour, they may feel undervalued or unheard, unable to build that connection with you.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
    <p>
        Someone’s shirt isn’t ironed!? Don’t allow your judgment to dwell as long as the person is kind, does their work sincerely, and most importantly doesn’t harm you.
        Someone’s questioning your POV? Pause, breathe, take a step back, and listen. If it makes sense, implement the changes. If not, OBSERVE but don’t ABSORB.
        Know that everyone’s operating with a story in their mind, a story difficult to change. Become aware not to let your insecurity come in the way of your discussion with that person. Harness a safe and secure energy inside of you and then carry forward your communication with the person.
