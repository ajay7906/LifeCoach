                        My coaching work and business are living, breathing entities of their own. I have been chosen as
                        a
                        medium to share them with the world. I am happy to say that my work as a life coach and inner
                        childhood trauma healer is about creating the conscious change in the world that so many
                        desperately need but are unaware of.

                        I see so many people struggling with their lives. Life is tough and not always a bed of roses.
                        These people have a strong desire to make their lives uncomplicated, and “think positive”
                        doesn’t
                        help them! That’s exactly where I help people. I help them make their life and communication
                        uncomplicated. I am a soul with a physical existence who has come to Earth to fulfill a specific
                        purpose and evolve spiritually. I place great importance on growing spiritually, which
                        eventually
                        helps me grow my coaching work.

            Yes, there have been numerous success stories, and I feel so happy to have witnessed them with the people
            who
            experienced those firsthand. This is God’s grace because after doing the work, the clients felt immensely
            relieved and healed and felt their power back.

                    A businesswoman faced difficulty making important decisions in her life. She was married for 25
                    years. After 18 years of marriage, she started her boutique business and opened a showroom. She
                    eventually shut it down because she wanted to do something more meaningful. As she embarked on an
                    entrepreneurship journey in her new business, she faced confusion about making decisions. As we did
                    inner childhood trauma healing for her, she went back in the past and realized her current struggle
                    is because rarely anyone supported her in her emotional turmoil when she got married. It was not
                    that
                    the family didn’t love her; they did, but they just dismissed her feelings and didn’t take her
                    concerns seriously. Maybe they were NOT aware! Since then, she became overly dependent on her
                    husband
                    for all significant life decisions including career and finances. As she healed herself in this
                    inner
                    child healing process, she found new courage in her to listen to her heart, make her own decisions,
                    and not fear others. The best part — She also had been experiencing pain in her right leg for many
                    years, and suddenly the pain VANISHED. I was in touch with her for the next 2 months, and the pain
                    didn’t reoccur then. She experienced deep healing.
